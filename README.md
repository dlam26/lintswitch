# Summary

*lint_switch* is a small Bash script that connects:

1. _incrontab_ which watches your files
1. _pylint_, _jslint_ and other linters, which warn you about possible problems
in your files
1. _zenity_, _notify-send_, and _root-tail_, which display the lint result.

The result is that your code is constantly being watched and linted,
in the background, without interrupting your workflow, unless
there is an error in your code.

# Installation

I have only tested lint_switch on Ubuntu. It should work on Debian.
It should work on other Unix-based operating systems, as long as you
can install the requirements.

## Install the requirements

> sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin incron zenity pylint pep8 rhino root-tail psmisc

You will probably already have some of these. No problem.

**Why?**

 - libnotify-bin gives us _notify-send_
 - psmisc gives us _killall_
 - rhino is needed to run _jslint_

To get Google Closure Lint::

    cd <temp_dir>
    svn checkout http://closure-linter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ closure-linter
    cd closure-linter
    python setup.py install

To get jslint:

 > wget http://www.jslint.com/rhino/jslint.js

## Check out lint_switch

> git clone git@github.com:grahamking/lint_switch.git

I like to symlink it from my bin directory

> cd ~/bin
> ln -s [your checkout]/lint_switch.sh

## Setup incrontab

Add your username to /etc/incron.allow:

> sudo bash -c "echo $(whoami) >> /etc/incron.allow"

Next, tell incron what to watch. 

First generate a list of relevant files:

 - Replace [full_proj_path] with the full path to your project. 
For example for a Django project I worked on recently
I used _/home/graham/Projects/fablistic/fabproject_. That is also the
directory the linter will run from.  
 - Note that you have to include the path twice in this command.
 - Replace [full_lint_switch_path] with the path and name for lint_switch.sh.
For example I use _/home/graham/bin/lint_switch.sh_
 - This will find all directories which contain 'py', 'js', or 'css' files.
Customise as required.

> find [full_proj_path] -name "*.py" -or -name "*.js" -or -name "*.css" | xargs -l1 dirname | sort | uniq | awk '{print $1" IN_ATTRIB [full_lint_switch_path] $@/$# [full_proj_path]"}'

Run incrontab and paste the result into it:

> incrontab -e

Do this for each project you want to watch and lint.

## Make sure your editor doesn't move the file

Vim, by default, when you save a file, moves it to create a backup, and
creates a new file. This means inotify (incron) is watching the old file.

Add this to your .vimrc:

> set nowritebackup 

## Test it

Open a python, javascript or css file in your favorite editor, and save it. 
You should see:

- If lint found an error: a modal popup.
- If lint found some warnings: A Gnome notification, and details written
directly on your desktop (root window).
- If lint is happy: Just a notification. Good job.

## Customise it - it's the Unix way

All this script does is wire together a number of other tools. It's just bash
script, and there are lots of comments. Hopefully you can customise it
for your particular situation.

## Contribute

I'd love to add linters for other languages, so if you do that locally,
please send me a patch. Thanks!
